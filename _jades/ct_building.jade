  p In 1985, Jim Golden ran a stall at the Saint Paul Farmers’ Market, selling hot coffee and delicious sandwiches. In 1998, he left his stall and made his move across the street to a permanent location, offering catering and window service.
After renovating the space, he opened as a full café and deli in the heart of Lowertown. Still using fresh produce, meat, and products from the Farmers Market, Jim and his friendly staff serve up an expansive breakfast, brunch, lunch, and nighttime appetizer menu.
